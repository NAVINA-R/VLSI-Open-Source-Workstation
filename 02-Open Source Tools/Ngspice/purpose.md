# Ngspice – Purpose

Ngspice is an open-source circuit simulation tool used for
analyzing analog and mixed-signal electronic circuits.

## Why Ngspice is used
- Simulates electrical behavior before fabrication
- Verifies voltage, current, power, and timing
- Helps validate circuit design correctness

## Applications
- Analog circuit analysis
- CMOS inverter simulation
- Amplifier and filter verification
- Educational and research use

Ngspice is commonly used along with schematic capture
and layout tools in a complete VLSI design flow.
